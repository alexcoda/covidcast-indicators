## Functions used to calculate column aggregations. Each function is meant to be
## used for a specific response type (binary, numeric, multiselect, multiple choice).

#' Wrapper for `compute_count_response` that adds sample_size. Val is the mean.
#'
#' @param response a vector of percentages (100 * cnt / total)
#' @param weight a vector of sample weights for inverse probability weighting;
#'   invariant up to a scaling factor
#' @param sample_size The sample size to use, which may be a non-integer (as
#'   responses from ZIPs that span geographical boundaries are weighted
#'   proportionately, and survey weights may also be applied)
#' @param total_represented Number of people represented in sample, which may
#'   be a non-integer
#' 
#' @return a list of named means and other descriptive statistics
